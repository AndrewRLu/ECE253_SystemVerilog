# ECE253 - SystemVerilog Processor

A FSM-based SystemVerilog implementation of a mumlti-cycle processor capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (`mv`, `add`, `sub`, `mult`), with control path and datapath.

Supports both register-register and register-immediate operations.

## Example: `Add` Operation
The included `wave.do` demonstrates `add` operation in ModelSim.
